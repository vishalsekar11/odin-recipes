        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These <strong>German potato pancakes</strong> are a nice change from regular pancakes. They make a great dinner meal when served with Bratwurst sausage. I spread mine with cranberry sauce and top with maple syrup.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>6 medium potatoes, peeled and shredded</li>
            <li> ½ cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat eggs, flour, baking powder, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl; stir in potatoes and onion. </li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of potato mixture into hot oil in batches. Press to flatten. Cook until browned and crisp, about 3 minutes on each side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining potato mix </li>
        </ol>
